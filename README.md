CWE → Common Weakness Enumerations

It describes the specific Software weakness like bugs or pour level of coding which makes the sortware not to work pooperly.
Each CWE is assainged a Specific number and a description of the vulneribility it is causing.

Access Control ----> it gives rules that who can do what things in a Software
ex : in our website that we created, only  admin can delete other uses whereas Users cannot delete others.
BAC - Broken Access control → When those rules failed like users also delete others.
CWEs related to BAC- 34

mar incidence Rate: → 55.97 % among the 34: CWEs that comes under this category , One with max occurence is having incidence of 56% • [CWE - 105).

the incidences means among the  no of  tested applications that have this CWE.

Avg incidence Rate :- The average of all the incidence rates of all CWEs  comes under that category.
-- [3.81%]
This says that each CWE is seen in 3•81% of the 100 applications.


Avg Weighted Exploit:- [6.92]

each CWE is assaigned a point or called weight based on chances of getting exploited.

more points (weight → easy to get explit or attack.

the avg of the all CWEs in the categary is called Avg weighted exploit.
more avg weighted Exploit  → more risk - easy to exploit

Avg weighted Impact: [5.93]

The Impact or damage a particular CWE done tO the application is also given points (weight) and the avg of all the CWEs of
particular Category is Avg Weighted Impact of that category.
 more avg weighted Impact → mose damaye if attack success.
 
max coverage:- It says the percentage of applications that cointain a CWE which belong to this BAC category.
Max coverage - 94.55%
it means of total no of applications  (94.55%) have atleast one CWE from the BAC category.

Avg Coverage: 47.72%
This tells That how many applications of total are subjected to the A01 (BAC) test for getting the data.
