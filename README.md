BAC SCENARIOES:-

1)CHANGING THE URL TO THE REQUIRED PAGE LIKE CHANGING THE DASHBOARD.PHP TO THE ADMIN.PHP 

IF THE PHP [BACKEND] DOES NOT VERFIY THEN IT WILL GIVE ACCESS TO THE ADMIN PANEL TO THE NORMAL USERS AS WELL.

THE SECURITY PROCESS  IS TO CHECK THE ROLE OF THE USER IN THE DATABASE.IF ONLY ADMIN THEN HE CAN SEE THE ADMIN LINK THERE.

2)BY KNOWING THE SESSION ID OF THE USER.

IF THE USER DID NOT DESTROY THE SESSION AND THE SESSION IS LEAKED BY SEVERAL METHODS LIKE IT IS VISIBLE IN THE GET METHOD IN THE URL THEN THE ATTACKER WILL ACCESS THE SESSION. 

TO STOP THIS WE NEED TO DESTROY THE SESSION.[AS PER THE OWASP COOKIE ALSO NEED TO BE DESTROYED BUT AS THE SESSION IS DESTROYED THE SESSION IS EMPTY SO THE COOKIE HAS A EMPTY SESSION VALUE SO NO NEED OF DESTROYING THE COOKIE.]

3)MODIFING THE API REQUESTES LIKE GET AND ALSO POST REQUESTS ALSO CAN BE MODIFIED USING SOME APPLICATIONS LIKE REQUESTLY.

CRYPTOGRAPHIC FAILURE:-

1)USING OF OLD PASSWORD HASHING ALGORITHMS LIKE (MD-5,SHA1).

THIS CAN BE CRACKED EASILY AND THE HASHED PASSOWRDS CAN BE LEAKED BY THE MISCONFIGURED DB ACCESS AND ETC.
THEY CAN BE CRACKEDBY USING SOME METHODS LIKE BRUT FORCE AND RAINBOW TABLE METHODS.


2)GENERATING THE WEAK RANDOM NUMBERS BY THE RNG THAT ARE USING IN THE PASSWORD HASHING AND SALTING.

IF THE NUMBERS ARE PREDICTABLLY EASY THEN IT CAN GET EASILY ACCESS BY THE ATTACKERS.
